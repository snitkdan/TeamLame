# Overview
This repository hosts the project files for CSE/EE 474: Embedded Systems @ the University of Washington. There is a "getting started" project (a1) and 4 main projects (a2 - a5) that compromise the development of a simulated satellite with several subsystems that emulate key functionality (e.g. thrusters, power, warning alarm, etc.) This satellite system was developed in C, unit tested with [https://github.com/google/googletest](Google's C++ testing framework), and deployed on the [https://beagleboard.org/black](Beaglebone black)
